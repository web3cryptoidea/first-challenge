This repository contains first challenge for Web Development Bootcamp.

## Description

As a web developer I wanted to refactor existing webpage to make it more accessible and optimized for search engines.
With this in mind I used existing started code to modify it so that the webpage follows accessibility standards.

The list of accessibility standards:
 - proper usage of HTML semantic elements;
 - all HTML elements follow a logical structure;
 - all image and icon elements contain *alt* attributes;
 - heading attributes are in sequential order;
 - all title elements are concise and discriptive. 

Refactored page ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assissting technologies and it is better positioned for easy search in machines like Google.

## Installation
N/A

## Usage 
This webpage is deployed as per html file provided, you can access it using the following URL: https://web3cryptoidea.github.io/first-challenge/
You can use Inspector tool and go through all the elements and attributes of *html* file and *css* files and look how they apply to the webpage.
Look at html and css files in the repositry to go through comments explaining modifications to achieve above mentioned accessibility standards.
